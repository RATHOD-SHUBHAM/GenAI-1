Customer: Hi, I'm calling because I'm having an issue with my car. I was driving on the highway and suddenly the check engine light came on and the car started shaking.

Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. That definitely sounds like an issue that needs to be addressed. Can you tell me what steps you've taken to resolve the issue?

Customer: I pulled over and checked the engine, but I couldn't see anything obviously wrong. I drove the car to a mechanic, but they were closed for the day.

Agent: Alright, it's good that you pulled over and checked the engine. It's possible that there's an issue with one of the engine components or the transmission. Have you tried restarting the car to see if the check engine light goes away?

Customer: Yes, I did that, but the light came back on after a few minutes of driving.

Agent: I see. Based on what you're describing, it's difficult to know for sure what the issue could be. I would recommend bringing the car into our service center so we can take a closer look and diagnose the problem.

Customer: Okay, but I'm not sure if I can bring it in right now. I have work all week and I need my car to get there.

Agent: I understand. We do offer rental cars if you need a temporary solution while we work on your car. Alternatively, we may be able to arrange for a tow truck to pick up your car and bring it to our service center.

Customer: That might work. How much would the rental car cost?

Agent: The cost of the rental car would depend on a few factors, such as the make and model of the car you choose and how long you need it for. I can give you an estimate if you'd like.

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Agent: Alright, based on our current rates, a rental car would cost about $40 per day for a mid-sized sedan. However, we do have other options available, so I would recommend speaking with our rental car specialist to find the best option for you.

Customer: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. Can you schedule a tow truck for me?

Agent: Of course. Let me check our availability. We have a tow truck available tomorrow morning at 9 am. Would that work for you?

Customer: Yes, that works for me. What should I do in the meantime?

Agent: It might be helpful to take note of any other issues or symptoms you notice while driving the car. Additionally, if you have any documentation related to previous repairs or maintenance on the car, it would be helpful to bring that in as well.

Customer: Alright, I'll do that. Thanks for your help.

Agent: You're welcome. We'll do our best to diagnose and resolve the issue as quickly and efficiently as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, that's all. Thanks again.

Agent: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a great day!
