Follow-Up:\n","\n","The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of further investigations, consultations, and to address any ongoing symptoms. The patient is advised to monitor his symptoms and report any significant changes or new symptoms before the next visit.\n","\n","VIII. Prognosis and Discussion:\n","\n","The presence of an enlarging liver mass raises concerns about potential malignancy. Further diagnostic testing and consultations with specialists are essential to determine the nature of the mass and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The patient's overall prognosis will be influenced by the nature of the liver mass and the success of treatment interventions. Close collaboration between the patient, medical team, and specialists will guide the management of his condition and optimize his chances of recovery.\n","\n","IX. Patient Education:\n","\n","The patient and his family will receive comprehensive education about the diagnostic process, potential treatment options, and the importance of adhering to medical recommendations. Emphasis will be placed on the need for regular follow-up appointments and open communication with the medical team to ensure the best possible outcomes.\n","\n","X. Conclusion:\n","\n","This patient report outlines the comprehensive health assessment of John Doe, a male patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and abdominal pain. The assessment encompasses a thorough medical history, review of systems, physical examination findings, diagnostic investigations, assessment, and a detailed plan for further evaluation and management. The collaboration between healthcare professionals and specialists will be crucial in guiding the patient's journey toward an accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and optimal health outcomes.\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"tMUn9y3LwYig","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698957640865,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":168,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["inputs=tokenizer.encode(\"sumarize: \" +sequence,return_tensors='pt', max_length=512, truncation=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"9NUz-FS2h--Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698957684358,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":131,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["output = model.generate(inputs, min_length=50, max_length=80, length_penalty = 5, num_beams = 2)"],"metadata":{"id":"mfPfx_afi2Ys","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698957958037,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":34378,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["summary=tokenizer.decode(output[0])"],"metadata":{"id":"2pDC7Vd2jstm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698957750985,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":197,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(summary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QwwOsinLkD8s","outputId":"3c20ab18-eea5-47f5-cac7-27aafb7e2396","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698957751882,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":166,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<pad><extra_id_0>: Data science is an interdisciplinary field[9] focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying that knowledge to solve problems in a wide range of application domains.

The Texas Freedom Colonies Project addresses the environmental injustice and land loss such localities often face, by working with descendant communities to foster the co-collection and co-curation of heritage materials, and the creation of counternarratives about these active cultural landscapes.

Drawing from critical geography, Black ecologies, and environmental law, Purifoy considers how the continuation of plantation regimes since the mid-19th century has led to persistent forms of extractive development targeting Black communities, wherever they exist. She works to unearth the historical conditions that have produced contemporary environmental injustice, in order to shape future thinking about place, ecology, and freedom.\n","\n","My keen interest in these scholars’ work arises from its transdisciplinarity. Roberts and Purifoy explore the praxes of Black placemaking across multiple timescales, and study threats to Black communities across the south and around the country — along with an array of models for addressing, mitigating, and resisting those threats. As a literary geographer, my own research examines Black women writers’ depictions of transnational migrations, and the ways in which conceptions of identity and home shift as characters in these narratives set out on the move.\n","\n","As nationalisms continue to beset Black women wherever they reside, I look to thinkers like Roberts, Purifoy, and their colleagues, who are modeling new ways of building community and facilitating belonging, in modes resistant to and unbounded by the exclusionary strictures of nationalism.\n","\n","I sat down with Roberts and Purifoy to discuss their work in mapping, planning, preservation, geography, and placekeeping.\"\"\"\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"PyGye97P0i9o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698959313839,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":141,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["batch = tokenizer(src_text, truncation=True, padding=\"longest\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(torch_device)\n","translated = model.generate(**batch, max_length = 150)\n","tgt_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(translated, skip_special_tokens=True)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AHKu2Qxc1pX0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698959516289,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2059,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}},"outputId":"69234a90-706a-439d-f655-28e05d4c0940"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:381: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`.

Political radicalization thus refers to change in beliefs, feelings, and actions toward increased support for one side of a political conflict.1\n","\n","Radicalization occurs to both sides in the back-and-forth of conflict. Nineteen Muslims were radicalized to attack the US on 9/11, and the US was radicalized in reaction. That reaction continues in 2020, eighteen years and trillions of dollars later, with a war on terrorism abroad and a growing security state at home.\n","\n","Often mentioned in relation to radicalization is political extremism. There is no objective definition of this term, but the US Government has tried to define a somewhat narrower concept, violent extremism: violent extremists are “individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals.”2 Two issues challenge this definition. First, the definition assumes that political violence is ideologically motivated. Second, the definition targets equally those who justify (“support”) political violence and those who commit political violence.\n","\n","The same two issues arise in relation to radicalization. Because radicalization includes the adoption of radical ideas, it is easy to assume that radical action, including terrorism, is caused by radical ideas. The same assumption leads to the conclusion that fighting radicalization means fighting both radical ideas and radical action\n","\n","Consider first the assumption that political violence is ideologically motivated. Political violence motivated by anger or shame is lost to this definition. Nor is it clear what counts as ideology. Case histories do not show young Muslims sitting up from their reading with the sudden conviction that the Koran orders them to Jihad. Similarly, case histories do not show Right Wing terrorists rising to attack after reading Hitler’s Mein Kampf.\n","\n","Political grievances are usually simpler than ideology: “They’re doing it to us and we’re not going to let them get away with it.” One might say that this counts as ideology—that motives of outrage and revenge count as ideology. In this case, ideology looks remarkably like the “moral sentiments” of empathy, indignation, and shame that are presumed to confer fitness advantages in human social interactions.3 Reference to ideology is consistent with the hegemony of rational choice theories in social science, but case materials show that radicalization to terrorism occurs in a welter of emotions.4\n","\n","Now consider the idea of targeting both radical ideas and radical actions. Conflating radical opinion with radical action ignores two results of research on terrorism: 99 percent of those with radical opinions never move to radical action, and many join a militant group without previous radical ideas.5 About 100,000 US Muslims believe that suicide attacks against civilians are often or sometimes justified in defense of Islam, but fewer than a thousand are seen as security threats.  Many join a militant group for status, power, comradeship, personal revenge, or escape from life problems—not for ideology.\n","    \"\"\"\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"hXLz7SGP3doo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698959607408,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":138,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}}},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["batch = tokenizer(src_txt, truncation=True, padding=\"longest\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(torch_device)\n","translated = model.generate(**batch, max_length = 150,temperature = 0, top_k = 2)\n","tgt_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(translated, skip_special_tokens=True)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4fiTzWtN37rm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698959610297,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2070,"user":{"displayName":"Colab Shubham","userId":"04861373210350452225"}},"outputId":"3d8eacb7-1a1c-4779-8486-1eac6aa7d970"},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:381: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`.

Underlying assumptions and points of entry on the conversation differ greatly. These span the range from reductionist mechanics (and all that discipline has contributed to our knowledge of evolutionary process) to the implications of the role of a top tier species like Homo sapiens as a “natural selector-in-chief”. Global thinking across this landscape is rather like a mosaic, with the gaps between the pieces varying in width and, metaphorically, how much grout has been placed therein to create any bridges.\n","\n","First of all, we have to acknowledge a broad landscape encompassing humankind’s historically subjective and objective ways of knowing -- whether reflecting the more conventional view of C. P. Snow’s “Two Cultures” (and a later suggested “Third Culture”), or the views of current “integral philosophies” recognizing various interactive domains or universes of discourse ranging from the more subjective (like arts and “spirituality”) to more objective (conventional science) in the endeavors of humankind. Moreover, in common parlance, depending on what “circles” one is in, some domains may be considered “in” (valid to discuss) and others “out” (considered invalid to discuss).\n","\n","There are, at one extreme of this landscape (and far from the conventional) views that center everything, material and otherwise, on consciousness itself.  These must be mentioned and may be a wave of the future. This view, developed (among others) by Drs. Deepak Chopra, Stuart Hameroff, Rudolf Tanzi, Peter Russell, Frederico Faggin and colleagues through the annual “Science and Nonduality Conference” is well summarized in the popular literature by Chopra.\n","\n","Within more conventional boundaries, a sizable mainstream literature exists on the complex feedback mechanisms by which the conscious activities of human agency affect the core mechanical elements of biological evolution itself.  Every time humans, in what Teilhard de Chardin referred to as the realm of consciousness [“noosphere”], do something affecting elements of the geosphere or biosphere humankind is part of influencing myriad aspects of the course of evolution. Today we are even aware that geosphere and biosphere are not clearly distinct, given the inherent interrelations of life-related gases and liquids in the process of Plate Tectonics.\n","\n","An academic discipline, modern “Discursive Theory” (21 million entries at Google) examines how human narratives and resulting actions create undeniable effects.  Examples widely range from the obvious effect on human history of certain books (Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf or Thomas Paines’ Common Sense as only two examples) to consequences, intended and unintended, of the “greening” of various industries in the latter 20th Century when a more “green narrative” was required by “political correctness” and had unintended consequences on both corporate cultures and environment arenas like pollution, resource extraction, deforestation and biodiversity. The latter example embraces myriad aspects influencing fundamental elements of biological evolution in geosphere and biosphere.\n","\n","Controversially, these interactions could be construed as reflecting Dr. Rupert Sheldrake’s contentious theories of “morphic fields”—the view that there are collective subjective effects on reality that influence the actual direction of development and events.  Indeed, conflating the more conventional examples above with those of Sheldrake reflects the sometimes “schizoid” nature of the current global discussion (in some circles, Discursive Theory as an “in” [valid to discuss]; Morphic Fields as an ‘out” [not valid to discuss]).\n","\n","An ambitious and extensive document by the Canadian Research Institute currently influential in the United Nations community reports in detail on the varieties of interaction between complex elements of human culture, feedback loops regarding human behavior, and resulting effects on the global environment both now and projected into the future. Interactions are highly nuanced, including innumerable interconnections of cultural narratives, religious beliefs, roles of science and technology in societies, changes and shifts in prevailing paradigms and worldviews (even social media), and the actual effects on multitudes of elements in the global environment itself and the relationship to biodiversity, environmental sustainability and so on. Across all these arenas, both the media (and fate) of humankind as well as the process of evolution are inextricably intertwined.\n","\n","As David Sloan Wilson said at recent conferences “Steering Toward the Omega Point”:  [my paraphrase] “When it comes to evolution’s relation to humankind and its cultures, someone has to be at the wheel. If not, we may find, in hindsight, that evolution took us somewhere we didn’t want to go.”\n","\n","Where to from here? There seems little doubt that this discussion worldwide is moving toward more integration and fewer silos. If we look at the “mosaic” of the discussion mentioned above, we can hope the gaps between the component conversations are naturally narrowing with time. However, this is a global conversation with all the foibles that come with that.
